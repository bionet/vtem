Video Time Encoding and Decoding Machines
=========================================

Package Description
-------------------
This package provides code to encode and decode videos with time encoding 
machines consisting of  gabor or centre surround
receptive fields followed by Integrate-and-fire neurons [1]_, [2]_ .
It supports both the pseudoinverse algorithm, described in [1]_, [2]_ and
recurrent neural networks method, described in [3]_ for decoding.
